# Local Store Diwali Sales Analysis 2022 Project

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Analyze Diwali sales based on different parameters: products, gender, state, age, occupation, and zone area of customers.
2. Enhance customer experience through data-driven insights.
3. Drive revenue growth by leveraging sales data.

## Data Analysis Workflow

### Loading Data and Data Cleaning
1. Imported Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn in a google colab.
2. Loaded the CSV file containing raw data using the pd.read_csv() function.
3. Used df.info() to understand column datatypes and null counts.
4. Removed useless columns with df.drop().
5. Eliminated rows with null values using df.dropna().

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Analyzed gender-based data using seaborn to visualize count and amount spent by each gender.
2. Explored age groups by plotting count and amount data, segregating by gender.
3. Analyzed orders and amount spent based on the state using seaborn graphs.
4. Examined marital status by plotting count and amount graphs, distinguishing gender.
5. Explored occupation-wise count and amount spent using graphs.
6. Analyzed product categories count and amount using visualization tools.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted, the following insights are drawn:

1. **Gender:** Females made more purchases and spent more than males.
2. **Age:** The age group 26–35, especially females, had the highest buying activity.
3. **State:** Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka generated the most orders and total amount.
4. **Marital Status:** Married customers, particularly married women, were more active buyers.
5. **Occupation:** IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sector workers were prominent buyers.
6. **Product Category:** Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most popular product categories.

## Project Takeaways
This project offers valuable insights to guide marketing strategies and customer engagement. It highlights the target audience—married women aged 26–35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation. Tailoring efforts towards Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories could potentially boost sales and revenue.
